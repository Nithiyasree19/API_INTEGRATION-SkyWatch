# SkyWatch – A Simple, Stylish Weather Web App

**SkyWatch** is a minimalistic, responsive weather web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed as part of my **Full Stack Web Development Internship at CODTECH**, to integrate a real-time public API and present the data in a clean, user-friendly interface.

In our modern digital age, having access to accurate and timely weather information has become an essential part of our daily routine — whether it’s planning a trip, preparing for the day’s outfit, or simply being aware of our local climate. **SkyWatch** serves those who need in a lightweight and elegant way, fetching real-time weather details directly from the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
